        Working with Interior Monkey has been an absolute pleasure. I used to think of
        interior design as a luxury, but through the process now see it as
        essential to a space as UX design is to software. Without exception
        everyone who walks into devbootcamp comments on how friendly and
        inviting the space is. Reham listened carefully to what we needed, and
        worked swiftly and professionally within our limited budget to create
        a space that we're extremely proud of.

      <p>Hello, my name is Reham Shadi. It’s nice to meet you.</p>
      <p>
        I live with my husband Ed and our chihuahua Gus in Berkeley, CA. I’ve also lived and worked as a commercial and residential
        interior designer for the last 10 years in Los Angeles, New York, Columbus, and Cairo.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m interested in how space can help us thrive, make us happy and create positive energy. I am fascinated by how the built environment
        affects our well-being, how different generations and cultures view their surroundings and how sustainable design creates a healthier
        physical environment. I believe we can reuse and salvage materials to create incredible, sustainable spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        I particularly enjoy working with start-ups. I’m a small business myself and I understand that start-ups have tight budgets and time lines
        but still want to create awesome spaces that foster their entrepreneurial spirit and creative energy. I love creating cool, affordable &
        sustainable interiors using salvaged, recycled & upcycled materials and furnishings.

      <h4>Sustainability</h4>
      <p>
        As much as I’m passionate about designing cool interiors, I also strive for the creation of sustainable spaces and the implementation of
        sustainable business practices. I believe that we must take care of the greater environment as well as support our local communities.
        These are some of my green initiatives:
        <ul>
          <li>In 2009 I became a LEED Accredited Professional.</li>
          <li>Interior Monkey is in the process of becoming a Bay Area Green Business.</li>
          <li>
            My goal is to incorporate environmentally friendly resources in my projects,
            including recycled, upcycled & reused materials and low-VOC products.
          </li>
          <li>I’ve been a volunteer with Project Seedlings, an environmental education program for Columbus inner city youth.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>Community</h4>
      <p>
        I like to source the majority of my materials and furnishings from businesses that benefit the local community and support the local economy,
        including architectural salvage shops, thrift stores and retailers that are socially and environmentally responsible.
